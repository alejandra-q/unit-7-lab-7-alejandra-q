Sample Data : 
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, alligator
fun, fly, four, six, times, ten, plus, eight

Sample Output : 
[one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, alligator]
word with 2 vowels = 5
word with 3 vowels = 0
word with 4 vowels = 1
word with 2 chars = 0
word with 3 chars = 3
word with 4 chars = 2
word with 5 chars = 2

after removing words with 3 chars 
[three, four, five, seven, alligator]

number of vowels in the words removed == 4



[fun, fly, four, six, times, ten, plus, eight]
word with 2 vowels = 3
word with 3 vowels = 0
word with 4 vowels = 0
word with 2 chars = 0
word with 3 chars = 4
word with 4 chars = 2
word with 5 chars = 2

after removing words with 3 chars 
[four, times, plus, eight]

number of vowels in the words removed == 3



[alligator, chicken, dog, cat, pig, buffalo]
word with 2 vowels = 1
word with 3 vowels = 1
word with 4 vowels = 1
word with 2 chars = 0
word with 3 chars = 3
word with 4 chars = 0
word with 9 chars = 1

after removing words with 3 chars 
[alligator, chicken, buffalo]

number of vowels in the words removed == 3
